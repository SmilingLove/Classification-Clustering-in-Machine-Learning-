# Classification-Clustering-in-Machine-Learning-
Overview


Applying various supervised classification models like Logistic regression , KNN, Decision tree helped us to predict readmissions of diabetic patients !!! Furthermore applying Unsupervised K-Mean clustering model over our Diabetic Dataset results in formation of various clusters ,visualizing these clusters gives us insight of what features or parameters we have to optimize to reduce the number of readmissions of diabetic patients . 



Big_data.pdf -> Pdf file to Understand what we actually want to do in this project




diabetic_data.csv -> .csv file of dataset




Task.pdf -> pdf file of a report on all the results we achieved in this project




Diabetic_ML_model.ipynb -> .ipynb file contains all the code part :)



thank you :)
